### Birthday Calculations
* have variables for each month; when user inputs their b-day (MM/DD), take in that information and add up previous months' days then the DD value given.

### Features
* form to generate sign (submit)
* list out playlists (DOMContentLoaded)
* tell them a bit about their sign (DOMContentLoaded)
* the user can access the playlists via links (click)

### Stretch Goals
* ...maybe the user can input their sign directly?

### Navigation of Project
1. **USER INPUT:** Do you know your zodiac already? (maybe) OR Welcome to the Spotify Astrology Collection! Please input your birth date in the format MM/DD, for example 04/14.
2. Convert that input into a day out of the year.
    * special scenario for 02/29
    * if 04/14, take that in as a string, split down middle by "/",
